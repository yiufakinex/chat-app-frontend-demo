## About

This is a relatively simple chat application created using React/TypeScript in the frontend. Users can create accounts using OAuth 2.0, form custom group chats, and send messages. The application leverages StompJS and SockJS (WebSocket) for real-time communication between users and utilizes MySQL for data persistence. Also, it uses Rate limiting to protect systems from being overwhelmed by too many requests in a short period and helps mitigate certain types of cyber-attacks, such as DoS attacks, by limiting the rate of requests.
